Basic example of spring MVC. Beginners Code 

How the application works! 
------------------------------------------------
 1. You have to instert user name and password and it will check in my local database if the credentials are valid or not. 
 2. If the credentials are valid it will take you to a registration form. 
 3. Enter your credentials in the registration form. 
 4. I didn't do validation check which I will do it later. 
 5. When you click submit it will store the details in my local database.

 Tips
 --------------------------------------------------
 1. Make sure there is no version miss match in the jar files. 
 2. Make sure to upload jar files in lib folder along with the class path. 
 3. Don't add jar files twice that will give you an error.
 4. I am using extra jar files for spring which are not needed. As this was my first attempt to learn spring there are lot of issues.
 5. The code can be optimised.
